What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
We create a .git folder which is hidden. We need to create a repository to start interacting with it.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area allows us to organize files before making a commit. It's different from the working directory or the repository because it's not something that remains present, once we commit we don't use the staging area anymore until the next commit.
